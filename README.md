# stata-archives
This is a collection of stata code snippets that I find useful for accounting research. </br>
I use Jupyter-lab with stata-setup package so that outcomes are provided with codes. For further information please check here: https://www.stata.com/new-in-stata/jupyter-notebooks/. In essence, stata commands can be used in Jupyter-lab in two ways </br>


```
%stata stata_command
```
or
```
%%stata
stata_command_1
stata_command_2
```
